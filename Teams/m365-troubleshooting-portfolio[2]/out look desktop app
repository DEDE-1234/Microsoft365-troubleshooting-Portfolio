# Case 3: Outlook Desktop Not Connecting to Exchange Online
## Issue  
User reports Outlook desktop app stuck on *"Trying to connect…"* when accessing mailbox hosted in Microsoft 365.  
Outlook on the web works fine.
## Root Cause  
Outlook profile was holding cached credentials after a recent password reset.  
Windows Credential Manager wasn’t updated, causing repeated authentication failures.
## Steps Taken  
1. Verified mailbox accessible via *Outlook Web App* → confirmed it’s not a service outage.  
2. Checked Outlook connection status (Ctrl + right-click Outlook icon → *Connection Status*).  
   - Saw repeated 401 Unauthorized errors.  
3. Cleared stored credentials from *Windows Credential Manager*.  
4. Re-launched Outlook → prompted for updated credentials.  
5. Repaired Outlook profile (Control Panel → Mail → Profiles).  
6. User logged in successfully; mailbox synced without errors.  
## Resolution  
Removed outdated credentials and reconfigured Outlook profile.  
## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Educate users to sign out and back in after password resets.  
- Encourage use of *modern authentication* and *conditional access policies*.
