# Case 5: Microsoft Teams Login Loop – User Cannot Sign In
## Issue  
User reports being repeatedly prompted to sign in to Microsoft Teams.  
After entering credentials, Teams reloads but returns to the sign-in page.  
User can access Teams via web browser without issues.
## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams Desktop App  
- Platform: Windows 11  
- Account Type: User account  
## Root Cause  
Stored authentication tokens in Teams cache conflicted with updated credentials after a password reset.  
This caused Teams to fail token validation and return to the sign-in loop.
## Steps Taken  
1. Verified user can access *Outlook and Teams Web App* → confirmed credentials are valid.  
2. Checked Microsoft 365 *Service Health Dashboard* → no outage reported.  
3. Signed out of Teams desktop client fully.  
4. Cleared Teams cache and credentials:  
   - %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams  
   - Windows *Credential Manager* → removed any cached Office/Teams entries.  
5. Rebooted PC and re-launched Teams.  
6. User signed in successfully and client synced properly.  
## Resolution  
Removed outdated tokens and cleared cached credentials.  
Teams desktop app re-registered fresh tokens after login.  
## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Encourage users to sign out of Teams after password changes instead of force-closing.  
- Periodically clear Teams cache on managed devices through automation (PowerShell/Intune).  
- Adopt Single Sign-On (SSO) where possible to reduce repeated logins.
