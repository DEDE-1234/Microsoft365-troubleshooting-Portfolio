# Case 13: Microsoft Teams – Meeting Chat Missing for Users

## Issue  
User reported that the chat panel was missing during Teams meetings.  
They could see video, participants, and share screen options, but the *Chat* tab was not visible.  
Other colleagues in the same meeting could see and use chat normally.  

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams (Meetings)  
- Platform: Desktop App and Web App  
- Account Type: Internal user  

## Root Cause  
Meeting chat was disabled due to *Teams Meeting Policy* applied via Microsoft Teams Admin Center.  
The affected user was under a restricted policy where meeting chat was set to *Disabled*.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Confirmed the issue occurred across both *Teams Desktop* and *Web App* → ruled out client corruption.  
2. Checked if the issue was *meeting-specific* → user had no chat option in any meeting.  
3. Reviewed Teams Admin Center → found user assigned to a custom Meeting Policy.  
   - Policy setting: Meeting chat = Disabled.  
4. Created/updated a new Meeting Policy with Meeting chat = Enabled.  
5. Assigned the correct policy to the affected user.  
6. Waited for policy replication (~30 minutes) and had the user re-login to Teams.  
7. User rejoined meeting → Chat tab was visible and functional.  

## Resolution  
Adjusted Teams Meeting Policy in the Admin Center to enable meeting chat for the user.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Review meeting policies before assigning them widely to users.  
- Communicate to users when restrictions (like chat disabled) are intentional.  
- Maintain a standard baseline policy with collaboration features enabled unless business reasons require otherwise.
