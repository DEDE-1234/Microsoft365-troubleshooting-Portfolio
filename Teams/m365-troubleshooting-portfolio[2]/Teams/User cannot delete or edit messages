 Microsoft Teams – User Cannot Edit or Delete Messages

## Issue  
User reported that they were unable to edit or delete their own messages in Teams chats and channels.  
The options to *Edit* or *Delete* did not appear when hovering over their messages.  

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams (Chat and Channel Messaging)  
- Platform: Teams Desktop and Web App  
- Account Type: Internal user  

## Root Cause  
A restrictive *Messaging Policy* was applied to the user account in Teams Admin Center.  
The policy had both Edit sent messages and Delete sent messages set to *Off*.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Verified issue was consistent across Teams Desktop and Web → not a client issue.  
2. Tested with another user → they had the option to edit/delete, confirming it was not global.  
3. Logged into *Teams Admin Center* → navigated to *Messaging Policies*.  
4. Checked the user’s assigned policy → confirmed both Edit sent messages and Delete sent messages were disabled.  
5. Updated the policy to allow editing and deleting messages, or assigned the user to the *Global (Org-wide default)* policy where those options were enabled.  
6. Asked the user to log out and back into Teams.  
7. Retested → edit and delete options appeared and worked as expected.  

## Resolution  
Adjusted the user’s Teams Messaging Policy to allow message editing and deletion.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Regularly review Teams Messaging Policies to align with organizational needs.  
- Document any intentional restrictions so users understand why features are missing.  
- Assign policies consistently to avoid confusion across departments.
