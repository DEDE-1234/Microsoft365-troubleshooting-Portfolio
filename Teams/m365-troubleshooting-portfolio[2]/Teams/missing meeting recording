 Microsoft Teams – Missing Meeting Recording

## Issue  
User reported that a Teams meeting they recorded did not appear in the chat after the meeting ended.  
Other participants also could not locate the recording link.  

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams (Meetings & Recording)  
- Platform: Teams Desktop and Web App  
- Storage: OneDrive/SharePoint (depending on meeting type)  
- Account Type: Internal user (Meeting Organizer)  

## Root Cause  
Meeting recordings in Teams are stored in *OneDrive (for private meetings)* or *SharePoint (for channel meetings)*.  
The recording was not visible in chat because the user’s recording policy was disabled at the tenant level, preventing automatic upload.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Verified recording indicator appeared during meeting → confirmed it was initiated successfully.  
2. Checked chat history after meeting → no recording link found.  
3. Navigated to *OneDrive → Recordings* folder for private meetings → folder missing recording file.  
4. Confirmed Teams Admin Center policy → Allow cloud recording = Off for the affected user’s policy.  
5. Updated the user’s Teams Meeting Policy to enable *Cloud Recording*.  
6. For the missing session, confirmed that the recording never uploaded due to policy restriction (could not be recovered).  
7. Tested with a new meeting after policy change → recording appeared in chat and stored in OneDrive automatically.  

## Resolution  
Enabled Teams Meeting Policy to allow cloud recording.  
User’s subsequent recordings uploaded correctly and appeared in chat/SharePoint as expected.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Ensure recording policies are enabled for roles that need them.  
- Inform users that recordings for *channel meetings* save to SharePoint, while *private meetings* save to the organizer’s OneDrive.  
- Encourage users to verify policy settings before important sessions.  
- Set up retention policies in Stream/SharePoint to manage recordings securely.
