# Case 7: Microsoft Teams – User Cannot Join Meetings via Desktop App

## Issue  
User reported they could not join any scheduled Teams meetings from the desktop client.  
Clicking on the meeting link opened Teams, but it stayed stuck on a blank screen.  
The same user could join meetings successfully through the browser version.  

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams Desktop App  
- Platform: Windows 11 Pro  
- Account Type: User account  

## Root Cause  
The issue was caused by corrupted Teams cache files and an outdated Teams client version that failed to load the meeting join protocol correctly.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Confirmed the user could join meetings on *Teams Web* → ruled out service-wide outage.  
2. Checked Microsoft 365 *Service Health Dashboard* → no reported incidents.  
3. Verified Teams version → found it was not updated to the latest build.  
4. Cleared Teams cache folders from:  
   - %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams  
   - %localappdata%\Microsoft\Teams  
5. Uninstalled Teams completely and reinstalled the latest version from Microsoft.  
6. Relaunched Teams and had the user test by joining a scheduled meeting → worked successfully.  

## Resolution  
Updated Teams client and cleared cache.  
User was able to join meetings from the desktop app without issues.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Encourage users to keep Teams client up to date.  
- Automate Teams updates via endpoint management (e.g., Intune).  
- Provide users with a quick workaround: use *Teams Web* if the desktop app fails.
