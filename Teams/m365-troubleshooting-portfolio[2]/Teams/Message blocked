: Microsoft Teams – Message Blocked Notification
## Issue  
User reported seeing *“This message has been blocked”* after sending a chat message in Teams.  
The recipient never received the message, and the sender could not resend it.  

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams (Chat and Messaging)  
- Platform: Teams Desktop App and Web App  
- Account Type: Internal user  

## Root Cause  
Message was blocked due to *Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance* or *Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy* applied in Microsoft 365.  
The policy flagged sensitive content (e.g., credit card numbers, restricted keywords) and automatically prevented delivery.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Verified user could send and receive other normal messages.  
2. Reproduced with a test message containing restricted terms → same block message appeared.  
3. Checked *Microsoft 365 Compliance Center → Data Loss Prevention policies*.  
4. Found that the organization had a DLP rule blocking sensitive data types from being shared in Teams chat.  
5. Worked with compliance admin to confirm the block was intentional and not a system error.  
6. Educated user on policy restrictions and why certain data cannot be sent via Teams.  

## Resolution  
Confirmed the block was triggered by compliance/DLP policies.  
No technical error—policy enforcement was working as designed.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Clearly communicate to users what data types are restricted in Teams.  
- Provide secure alternatives (e.g., encrypted email or approved file-sharing system) for handling sensitive data.  
- Regularly review DLP and communication compliance rules to ensure they align with business needs.
