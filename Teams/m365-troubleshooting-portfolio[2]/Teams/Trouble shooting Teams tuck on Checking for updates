# Case 4: Microsoft Teams Not Loading – Stuck on "Checking for Updates"

## Issue  
User reports that Microsoft Teams desktop app is stuck on *"Checking for updates"* and does not progress to the sign-in screen.  
Teams web app works fine in browser.

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams Desktop App  
- Platform: Windows 10 Pro  
- Account Type: User account  

## Root Cause  
Corrupted Teams cache files were preventing the desktop client from initializing properly.

## Steps Taken  
1. Verified Teams availability on *web version* → confirmed service was healthy.  
2. Checked Microsoft 365 Service Health Dashboard → no reported outages.  
3. Closed Teams client completely from the system tray.  
4. Deleted cache files from:  
   - %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams  
   - %localappdata%\Microsoft\Teams  
   - %localappdata%\Microsoft\TeamsMeetingAddin  
   - %localappdata%\SquirrelTemp  
5. Relaunched Teams → prompted for fresh sign-in.  
6. User successfully signed in and Teams loaded without errors.  

## Resolution  
Cleared corrupted Teams cache files and restarted the client.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Instruct users to use Teams web app temporarily if desktop issues persist.  
- Educate users on how to clear Teams cache when login or loading errors occur.  
- Keep Teams client updated via company-wide endpoint management (e.g., Intune).
