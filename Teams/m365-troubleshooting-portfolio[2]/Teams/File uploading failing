# Case 11: Microsoft Teams Web App – File Upload Failing

## Issue  
User reported being unable to upload files to a Teams channel when using the Web App.  
Upload showed “Failed” immediately, while desktop Teams worked fine.  

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams Web App  
- Platform: Chrome (latest) on Windows 11  
- Account Type: User account  

## Root Cause  
Pop-up blockers and third-party browser extensions (ad-blocker) were interfering with Teams file upload process.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Reproduced the issue with user account → upload failed instantly.  
2. Verified file upload worked from Teams Desktop → confirmed issue isolated to browser.  
3. Disabled Chrome extensions temporarily → upload succeeded.  
4. Narrowed down cause to ad-blocker extension blocking SharePoint/OneDrive upload calls.  
5. Whitelisted *.sharepoint.com and *.teams.microsoft.com in extension settings.  
6. Retested → user could upload files successfully.  

## Resolution  
Adjusted browser extension settings to allow Teams file uploads.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Recommend disabling unnecessary extensions for Teams Web.  
- Educate users that Teams file uploads rely on SharePoint/OneDrive backend.
