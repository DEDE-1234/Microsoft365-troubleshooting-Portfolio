 Microsoft Teams – Dial-In Users Cannot Join Meetings

## Issue  
External participants reported they could not join a Teams meeting via phone dial-in.  
They received the invite but there was *no dial-in number or conference ID* included.  
Internal participants joining via Teams client had no issues.  

## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams (Audio Conferencing)  
- Platform: Phone dial-in (PSTN)  
- Account Type: External users invited to Teams meeting  

## Root Cause  
The meeting organizer did not have an *Audio Conferencing license* assigned in Microsoft 365.  
Without the license, Teams meeting invites did not include a dial-in number or conference ID.  

## Steps Taken  
1. Reviewed the meeting invite → confirmed no dial-in details were present.  
2. Checked Microsoft 365 admin center → organizer account had a standard Teams license but no *Audio Conferencing add-on*.  
3. Assigned an *Audio Conferencing license* to the organizer.  
4. Had the organizer reschedule a new meeting after license propagation.  
5. Verified the new meeting invite included a dial-in number and conference ID.  
6. Tested with external participant → successful dial-in connection.  

## Resolution  
Assigned the proper Audio Conferencing license to the organizer.  
New meeting invites generated with dial-in numbers and conference IDs.  

## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Ensure Audio Conferencing licenses are assigned to users who regularly host external meetings.  
- Communicate clearly to meeting organizers that invites must be regenerated after license changes.  
- Periodically audit licensing to confirm all required features are enabled.
