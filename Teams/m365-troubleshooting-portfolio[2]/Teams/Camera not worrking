 Microsoft Teams Meeting – Camera Not Working
## Issue  
User complained that during Teams meetings, their camera was not detected.  
Other apps (Zoom, Camera app) worked fine, but Teams only showed a black screen.  
## Environment  
- Application/Service: Microsoft Teams Desktop App  
- Platform: Windows 10 Enterprise  
- Account Type: User account  
## Root Cause  
Teams was not granted camera permissions in Windows Privacy settings.  
Additionally, old Teams cache files were interfering with device detection. 
## Steps Taken  
1. Confirmed the camera worked in other apps → ruled out hardware failure.  
2. Checked *Device Manager* → camera was enabled and drivers up to date.  
3. Opened *Windows Settings → Privacy → Camera* → noticed Teams was not allowed access.  
4. Enabled camera access for Microsoft Teams.  
5. Cleared Teams cache from %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams to remove old device config.  
6. Relaunched Teams, joined a test meeting → camera detected and working.  
## Resolution  
Granted Teams camera permissions in Windows and cleared cache.  
User could join meetings with full video functionality.  
## Prevention / Best Practice  
- Remind users to verify app permissions after Windows updates.  
- Encourage use of the *Teams web app* as a quick workaround during urgent meetings.  
- Regularly update Teams client to avoid compatibility issues with Windows privacy settings.
